A non-negative integer is called _heavy_ if the average value of its digits in decimal representation exceeds 7. Assume that 0 has an average value of its digits equal to 0.

For example, the number 8,698 is heavy because the average value of its digits is (8+6+9+8)/4 = 7.75. The number 53,141 has an average value of its digits of (5+3+1+4+1)/5 = 2.8, so it is not heavy.

Write a function:

> <tt>
> int solution(int A, int B);
> </tt>

that, given two non-negative integers A and B, returns the number of heavy integers within the interval [A..B] (both ends included).

Assume that:

> *   A and B are integers within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">200,000,000</span>];
> *   A â‰¤ B.

For example, given A=8,675 and B=8,689 the function should return 5, because there are five heavy integers within the range [8,675..8,689]:

> <pre><tt>8675    avg=6.50
> 8676    avg=6.75
> 8677    avg=7.00
> 8678    avg=7.25    HEAVY
> 8679    avg=7.50    HEAVY
> 8680    avg=5.50
> 8681    avg=5.75
> 8682    avg=6.00
> 8683    avg=6.25
> 8684    avg=6.50
> 8685    avg=6.75
> 8686    avg=7.00
> 8687    avg=7.25    HEAVY
> 8688    avg=7.50    HEAVY
> 8689    avg=7.75    HEAVY</tt></pre>

Complexity:

> *   expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(B)<sup>3</sup>);
> *   expected worst-case space complexity is O(log(B)).
